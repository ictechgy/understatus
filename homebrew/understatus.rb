# Homebrew formula for understatus (prebuilt binary)
# Tap: ictechgy/homebrew-understatus
# Formula path in tap repo: Formula/understatus.rb
#
# This formula installs a PREBUILT understatus binary from GitHub Releases.
# No Xcode Command Line Tools and no Rust toolchain are required — the binary
# is downloaded and dropped into place (no compilation). macOS only
# (Apple Silicon + Intel); the binary's deployment target is macOS 11.0, so it
# runs on macOS 11 (Big Sur) and newer.
#
# Previous versions built from source (depends_on "rust" => :build +
# `cargo install`), which forced every user to install the full Xcode Command
# Line Tools just to compile. Switching to the prebuilt binary removes that
# requirement entirely.
